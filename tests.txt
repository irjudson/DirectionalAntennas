So how about:

Scenario 1:
M = 8, n = 8, 10, 12, 14, 16
get throughput and fairness for all als, including optimal

Scenario 2:
M = 8, n = 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
get throughput and fairness for all als, exclude optimal

Scenario 3:
n = 20, M = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
get throughput and fairness for all als, exclude optimal

Maybe we should get 5 runs for each parameter combo and average.  We
should also dump the coordinates to the file of each run so that if
Yun wants she can run her greedy alg on the same data.
